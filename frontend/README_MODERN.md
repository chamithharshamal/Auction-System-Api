# Modern AuctionHub UI

This is a modern redesign of the AuctionHub frontend application with a focus on contemporary design principles and improved user experience.

## Design Principles

### Color Palette (60-30-10 Rule)
- **60% Primary**: Deep Teal (#00796b) - Calming and professional
- **30% Secondary**: Warm Gray (#757575) - Neutral and versatile
- **10% Accent**: Coral/Peach (#ff6b6b) - Energetic and inviting

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter (with fallbacks to system fonts)
- **Hierarchy**: Clear visual hierarchy with bold headings and readable body text
- **Weights**: Range from 400 (regular) to 800 (extra bold)

### Spacing & Layout
- **Consistent Padding**: Uniform spacing system (8px base unit)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints
- **Full-width Utilization**: Maximum use of screen real estate

### Component Design
- **Cards**: Elevated with subtle shadows and hover effects
- **Buttons**: Rounded with smooth transitions and clear feedback
